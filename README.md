# FraudDetection
Fraudulent transactions pose an increasing challenge for fintech companies. A dataset of over 51,000 transactions is available, labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate, reflecting real-world patterns. This dataset includes details on transactions, user behavior, payment methods, and device usage, making it suitable for:

- **Fraud detection modeling** (classification)
- **Feature engineering** and **anomaly detection**
- **Exploratory data analysis** (EDA) and **pattern recognition**
