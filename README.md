Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using a labeled dataset of over 51,000 real-world records. The dataset includes a wide range of attributes such as transaction details, user behavior, payment methods, and device usage. Through a combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning, this project aims to identify patterns that distinguish fraudulent activities from legitimate ones.

📁 Project Overview
Fraudulent transactions pose a growing challenge for fintech companies, leading to financial losses, damaged reputations, and reduced customer trust. This project uses a comprehensive dataset to:

Understand the characteristics of fraudulent behavior

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and pattern recognition

Engineer features that enhance model accuracy

Train and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection

🎯 Objectives
Analyze transaction and user data to identify anomalies

Develop a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions

Apply feature engineering to improve predictive performance

Visualize key trends and patterns in fraudulent vs. legitimate activity

🧰 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation


Colab Notebook – Interactive analysis


📊 Key Features in the Dataset
Transaction amount, time, and location

User ID and behavioral patterns

Payment methods and account types

Device and browser metadata

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA phase involves:

Visualizing distributions and imbalances between fraudulent and legitimate transactions

Identifying correlations and outliers

Understanding temporal and device-based fraud patterns

🤖 Modeling & Results
Classification models such as Logistic Regression was trained and compared using metrics like:

Precision, Recall, F1-score and confusion matrix

🛡️ Challenges
Extreme class imbalance between fraudulent and legitimate transactions

Avoiding false positives that impact legitimate users

Designing interpretable models for financial decision-makers
